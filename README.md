# LearnPython
I'm already familiar with Python, but am learning other programming languages. As I teach myself, I start with the following three small apps to familiarize myself with the basics:
* HelloWorld - the classic first program in any language
* Anagram - find anagrams from a user-input word
* Pizza - basic pizza ordering system
